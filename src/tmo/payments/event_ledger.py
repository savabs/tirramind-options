"""Processed-webhook-event ledger — the actual replay defense.

`verify_webhook_signature`'s timestamp check (webhook.py) only bounds *how
long* a captured, validly-signed webhook stays replayable — it does not stop
a replay *within* that window. A captured `subscription.activated` webhook,
sniffed off a proxy access log or a captured browser devtools session, is a
byte-for-byte valid request until its `ts` ages out. Within the window it can
be POSTed again (e.g. to flip a subsequently-canceled subscription back to
active) and the signature alone will not catch it.

Paddle's payload includes a stable, globally-unique `event_id` on every
delivery (e.g. "evt_01h..."), including retries of the same event — a retry
re-delivers the same event_id, not a new one. This ledger records event_ids
we've already applied and rejects a repeat, whether that repeat is a benign
Paddle retry (should be a no-op, not a double-write — see idempotency) or a
malicious replay (should be a no-op, not a re-activation).

Bounded: entries are pruned by age on every write, AND hard-capped by count,
so the ledger cannot grow without bound even under a clock anomaly or a
burst of traffic. Persisted to disk (same JSON-file pattern as
SubscriberStore) so it survives a process restart — an in-memory-only ledger
would forget every event on deploy/crash and reopen the exact replay window
the timestamp check was tightened to close.
